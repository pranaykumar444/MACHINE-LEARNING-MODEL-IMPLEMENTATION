This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple machine learning model using Python and the Scikit-learn library. The model is designed to classify data and predict outcomes based on patterns identified during training. The widely known Iris flower dataset is used as the input for this project, allowing the model to learn how to distinguish between different species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.

This application showcases the fundamentals of supervised learning using a decision tree classifier. It is built for beginners and intermediate-level learners who want to understand the process of training, testing, and evaluating machine learning models using standard libraries and datasets.

The goal of this project is to introduce the basic steps involved in machine learning workflows—such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation—using a clean and readable Python implementation.


TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:

PYTHON 3.X: The core language used for development of the script.

SCIKIT-LEARN: A powerful machine learning library in Python used for building and evaluating classification models. It provides pre-built algorithms, datasets, and evaluation tools.

PANDAS: Used for organizing and managing the dataset in a structured format (DataFrame).

NUMPY: Supports array-based mathematical operations internally through Scikit-learn.

MATPLOTLIB (optional): Can be used to visualize confusion matrices and performance results.

These tools are industry-standard in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence and are commonly used in academic as well as professional environments.


PLATFORM:

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code on a Windows 11 platform. It is platform-independent and can run on any operating system that supports Python, including Linux and macOS. All dependencies can be easily installed using pip.


FEATURES:

LOADS STANDARD DATASET: Utilizes the Iris dataset available within Scikit-learn to avoid manual file handling.

TRAIN-TEST SPLIT: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

MODEL TRAINING: Uses a Decision Tree Classifier to learn from the training data.

PREDICTION: Performs classification on the test data and generates predicted labels.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: Calculates accuracy and can be extended to show confusion matrix and classification reports.

CODE CLARITY: The script is clean, well-commented, and easy to understand, making it ideal for learning purposes.


POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:

EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES:
This project is a great starting point for students learning machine learning. It demonstrates essential concepts like data splitting, training, and prediction.

BEGINNER DATA SCIENCE PORTFOLIOS
Can be included in portfolios to showcase understanding of classification algorithms, especially for job interviews or internships.

TEMPLATE FOR CUSTOM DATASETS
The script structure can be reused and modified to train models on custom datasets beyond the Iris dataset.

DEMO PROJECT FOR ML COURSES
Useful for instructors and learners in courses focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning, or data analytics.

INTERNAL PREDICTION TOOLS
A simple base model like this can be integrated into lightweight applications that require decision-based classification.


HOW IT WORKS:

The script imports the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.

It separates the dataset into input features and target labels.

The dataset is then split into training and test sets using a 70-30 ratio.

A decision tree classifier is created and trained on the training data.

Predictions are made on the test data, and accuracy is calculated using Scikit-learn’s built-in metrics.

The final accuracy is displayed as a percentage in the terminal.


HOW TO RUN:

Install the required libraries:

pip install scikit-learn pandas

Run the script:

python classification_model.py

Output:

Model Accuracy: 96.67%
